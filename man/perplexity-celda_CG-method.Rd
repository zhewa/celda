\title{Calculate the perplexity on new data with a celda_CG model}
\usage{
\S4method{perplexity}{celda_CG}(counts, celdaMod, newCounts = NULL)

\S4method{perplexity}{celda_CG}(counts, celdaMod, newCounts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Integer matrix. Rows represent features and columns represent
cells. This matrix should be the same as the one used to generate
`celdaMod`.}

\item{celdaMod}{Celda object of class "celda_C", "celda_G" or "celda_CG".}

\item{newCounts}{A new counts matrix used to calculate perplexity. If NULL,
perplexity will be calculated for the 'counts' matrix. Default NULL.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The perplexity for the provided count data and model.

Numeric. The perplexity for the provided count data and model.

\description{
Perplexity is a statistical measure of how well a probability
 model can predict new data. Lower perplexity indicates a better model.
